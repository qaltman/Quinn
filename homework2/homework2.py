# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# git is basically the controll system, github is a web platform that hosts git repositories, and git bash is the command line tool that is used to interact with git on windows.
# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# command line is where you interact with the computer where the terminal is the software that allows you to input the commands from the command line .
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# these are two different architextures as a whole where powershell is object oriented and git bash is text oriented or it commands the unix as plain text streams. 
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# python is the programing language itself, conda is the package manager that allows you to create isolated enviorments in python and anaconda is a distribution package that includes these commonly used languages and enviroemnts. 
# 5) What is VS Code? 
# this is basically a free app where you can write and run code.
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# juipter notebook allows you to write code in cells and run them one by one great for note taking plots and math. jupyter lab is a new more powerful workspace built around notebooks, it can open notebooks and behaves like an IDE. 
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
#this is used to map directly to your home directory. 
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#absolute path is the full adress to a file system where a relative path is written from the current location you are residing in. where . is a current folder and .. is a parent folder 
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# absolute /c/Users/Quinn/python_decal/Quinn/homework2 relative: ../python_decal/Quinn/homework2
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# this would be the cd .. command which allows you to go back a file or directory .
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#this would attempt to remove the current directory!
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add - stages changes for the next commit 
# git commit - saves a snapshot of the staged changes to your local repo history 
# git push - uploads your local commits to a remote repo like git hub 

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add . stages all changes in the current folder where adding the file stages only that file 
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# git status shows what changed essentially or staged, git log -1 shows the most recent commit that was made 
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#cloning will download a repositiory to your computer where pull updates the existing copy from the remote 
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#when i could not link repositories because of a module not found error. this happened becuase the python packages were not installed in the correct enviorment on my computer.
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# in much of my coding i get confused on what python interpretor or enviroemnt is being run in VS code and how to know the correct one to use based on the packages you are coding with. 
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# i have a cat named olive and she is pretty awesome.
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print (2**10) # I like this command because I use power operations a lot and its fun to write lol.
